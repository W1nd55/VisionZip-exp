Metrics Calculation:
  Accuracy = (TP + TN) / Total = (746 + 1072) / 2298 = 0.791 (79.1%)
  Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = 746 / (746 + 77) = 0.906 (90.6%)
  Recall = TP / (TP + FN) = 746 / (746 + 403) = 0.649 (64.9%)
  F1 = 2 * Precision * Recall / (Precision + Recall) = 2 * 0.906 * 0.649 / (0.906 + 0.649) = 0.757 (75.7%)
  Yes ratio = 0.358 (35.8%) - Proportion of "yes" predictions

Metrics Calculation:
  Accuracy = (TP + TN) / Total = (746 + 1122) / 2298 = 0.813 (81.3%)
  Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = 746 / (746 + 27) = 0.965 (96.5%)
  Recall = TP / (TP + FN) = 746 / (746 + 403) = 0.649 (64.9%)
  F1 = 2 * Precision * Recall / (Precision + Recall) = 2 * 0.965 * 0.649 / (0.965 + 0.649) = 0.776 (77.6%)
  Yes ratio = 0.336 (33.6%) - Proportion of "yes" predictions

Metrics Calculation:
  Accuracy = (TP + TN) / Total = (746 + 1049) / 2227 = 0.806 (80.6%)
  Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = 746 / (746 + 29) = 0.963 (96.3%)
  Recall = TP / (TP + FN) = 746 / (746 + 403) = 0.649 (64.9%)
  F1 = 2 * Precision * Recall / (Precision + Recall) = 2 * 0.963 * 0.649 / (0.963 + 0.649) = 0.775 (77.5%)
  Yes ratio = 0.348 (34.8%) - Proportion of "yes" predictions
